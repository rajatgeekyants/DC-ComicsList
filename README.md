# Dependencies 
* React
* JSON Server
* MobX
* MobX-React
* MobX-State-Tree

# Steps To Install
1. Clone the repo onto your system
2. Open the command terminal, go to the directory where you have cloned the repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. To start your JSON server, run `yarn run json-server --port 3000 db.json`
5. Now run the command `yarn start`. The terminal will ask you if you want to run it on another port since port 3000 is already running the JSON server. Say yes!
